Busch Gardens Williamsburg - Best Route

This is a map of the best route for those looking to ride every roller coaster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg in Virginia, from Groverâ€™s Alpine Express, the kiddie coaster in the Sesame Street Forest of Fun section of the park to the more intimidating Griffon, with its 90 degree vertical drop towering over every other attraction in the park.

Hovering over each pin on the map will show information about each roller coaster including the name of the coaster, the year it opened, the company who manufactured it, and the model of the coaster.

Clicking the link in the description on the webpage will take users to a stylized official 2025 park map which will show all attractions, shows, and experiences in much more detail. This map is accurate as of October 2025.
